**Blue Brain Open Platform** - Documents
========================================

This is a work-in-progress repository containing the [Architecture Documentation](docs/) of the **Blue Brain Open Platform**, as well as the review documents for the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](waf).

For convenience, the file format utilized for the documentation is [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and for the diagrams is Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) made with [Draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio). The plan would be to either publish a GitHub Page at some point, or to generate a proper documentation via other means.
