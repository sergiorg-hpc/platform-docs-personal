AWS Well-Architected Framework Review
=====================================

The **AWS Well-Architected Framework** describes key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud. This repository contains the review documents that are allowing us to understand how well the [Blue Brain Open Platform Architecture](../docs/) aligns with cloud best practices on AWS.

> [!WARNING]
> This is a work-in-progress repository and the different pillars will be added as soon as the reviews are conducted.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't forget:** Use [VSCode on GitHub](https://github.dev/BlueBrain/platform-docs) to edit the different sections, as well as to create/modify the diagrams via the recommended [Draw.io plugin](https://www.drawio.com/blog/edit-diagrams-with-github-dev) for VSCode.
