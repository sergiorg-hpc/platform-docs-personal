Architecture Documentation
==========================

The main goal of this repository is to provide a technical overview of the **Blue Brain Open Platform** and its overall architecture running on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). In particular, each section contains some of the most relevant technical decisions and design considerations, as well as provides other relevant details such as which AWS services are required, among others.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Don't forget:** Use [VSCode on GitHub](https://github.dev/BlueBrain/platform-docs) to edit the different sections, as well as to create/modify the diagrams via the recommended [Draw.io plugin](https://www.drawio.com/blog/edit-diagrams-with-github-dev) for VSCode.
